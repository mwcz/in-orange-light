In Orange Light
===============

Brainstorming for my compo game for LD39.

In Orange Light is a game about surviving the winter in an isolated cabin with too few supplies.

Game elements
-------------

A diesel generator is the heartbeat of the cabin.  You do not have enough fuel.

A space heater nearly keeps you warm enough.

A lamp's light eases your nerves at night.

Balance fuel consumption against your need for warmth, (heated) food, and sanity.  Survive the winter.

Player goals
------------

 - Keep body temp above hypothermia
 - Stay fed
 - Stay sane enough

Player engagement
-----------------

 - Read narrative about the circumstances
 - Set rate of food rationing, "I did some ration math -- I barely had the strength to hold the pencil -- and it's not good.  I'm going to cut back."
 - Set generator power level, "Fuel is about halfway gone already.  I'll go without the lamp tonight."
 - Refuel generator - active click, must go outside, costing body temp, "The door froze shut while I was out.  Started to think it wouldn't be that bad a way to go.  Then thought better of it, bruised up my shoulder busting the door loose."

Stretch goals
-------------

Events, or crises, like a blizzard, a broken window, a fever, that tax your resources even further.
