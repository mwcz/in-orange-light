In Orange Light is a scenic survival game.  In a lonely, rickety cabin at the top of a mountain, you must survive Winter.  A space heater, powered by a diesel generator, is your only source of heat.  Stay *warm*, stay *fed* and you will live see the Spring.

## Tools

 - Game engine: [Phaser.js][phaser]
 - Coding: [vim][vim]
 - Image creation: [Inkscape][inkscape]
 - Post processing: [GIMP][gimp]
 - Audio creation: [beepbox][beepbox]

## Tips

If you're having trouble surviving until Spring, take a few tries to learn how the resources affect each other.  When you hover over the fuel tank, the cupboard, etc, it will highlight the resources affected.  For example, hovering over the fuel tank will highlight FUEL and GENERATOR, because it affects both.
